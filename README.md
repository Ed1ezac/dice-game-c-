# dice-game-c++

This is a C++ program of a game that is played based on the following rules;

1. The game is played by two players. The first player to reach a total score of 100 or more is the winner
2. The game uses just one die, and players take turns rolling it.
3. If a player rolls a 6, s/he rolls again up to a maximum of three rolls per turn.
4. If a player rolls three consecutive 6’s, she loses her turn and scores zero points.
5. A player’s score on any turn is the total of her roll(s) on that turn. E.g. if you roll a 2, your score is 2. If you roll a 6 then a 2 your score is 8
6. The players are using a fair die for the game. When you roll a fair die it can either result in a 1, 2,3,4,5 or 6.
